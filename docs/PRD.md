# Product Requirements Document (PRD): RAG & Knowledge Engine System Reference

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Goal
This document outlines the requirements for a reference implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based knowledge engine system. The primary goal is to provide developers and researchers with a clear, functional, and extensible example built using Python and LangChain, following modern best practices. Refer to `../.cursor/rules/_project.mdc` for the overall project vision.

### 1.2 Target Audience
*   Developers building RAG or agentic systems.
*   Researchers exploring RAG techniques and performance.
*   Teams looking for a baseline implementation to adapt and extend.

## 2. High-Level Requirements

### 2.1 Baseline RAG Pipeline (Iteration 1)
*   **HLR-001:** Implement a basic, end-to-end RAG pipeline.
*   **HLR-002:** Support ingestion of common document formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`).
*   **HLR-003:** Utilize a configurable vector store for document embeddings.
*   **HLR-004:** Perform semantic similarity search for retrieval based on user queries.
*   **HLR-005:** Generate coherent answers based on retrieved context using a configurable LLM.
*   **HLR-006:** Provide a simple interface (e.g., CLI or basic API endpoint) for users to ask questions.
*   **HLR-007:** Ensure components (LLM, Embedding Model, Vector Store) are easily configurable.

### 2.2 Modularity and Extensibility
*   **HLR-008:** Design the system with modular components (e.g., document loader, splitter, retriever, generator).
*   **HLR-009:** Facilitate easy replacement or addition of components for experimentation.

### 2.3 Future Iterations (Placeholders)
*   **HLR-F01:** Incorporate advanced query understanding/transformation techniques.
*   **HLR-F02:** Implement advanced retrieval strategies (e.g., hybrid search, re-ranking).
*   **HLR-F03:** Integrate agentic components for task decomposition or tool use.
*   **HLR-F04:** Include a basic evaluation framework to assess RAG performance.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-001:** Code Quality: Adhere to `flake8` and `mypy` standards defined in `../.cursor/rules/_global.mdc`.
*   **NFR-002:** Documentation: Provide clear code comments and necessary documentation (like this PRD and the TECH_SPEC).
*   **NFR-003:** Logging: Implement sufficient logging for observability, following principles in `../.cursor/rules/_global.mdc`.
*   **NFR-004:** Testability: Ensure components are testable, with unit tests written using `pytest`.
