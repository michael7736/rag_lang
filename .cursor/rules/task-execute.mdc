## Task Execution Guidance

Execute instructions provided in an included task file (e.g., `<task>.md`).*

- Follow the instructions in the included `<task>.md` file *exactly* as given.
- Before each commit, perform the specified **Verification** step(s) for that commit.
- After each successful `git commit`, update the corresponding commit title line in the `<task>.md` file with a âœ… emoji and the commit SHA hash.

## After Each Commit

- Agressively proceed working on the next commit without asking for input.
- Forge ahead until the entire task is completed

## A Task is Only Done Once These 3 Criteria are Met
1. The task is only done after all commits are complete
2. The task is only done after all tests pass
3. The task is only done after all verifications work

To be clear, the definition "Task Done" has 3 parts:
1. commits complete
2. tests pass
3. verifications work

## After the Task is Done

Once the task is done, run the `.cursor/rules/update-project.mdc` with the following information:
1. Failures that could have been avoided
2. Changes to project behavior or expectations

## Avoid Unnecessary Language

Avoid unnecessary language after a commit is complete:

<bad_example>
Commit 1 complete and verified.
All test timeouts reduced, excessive logging added, and verification steps performed.
Proceeding to Commit 2: tackle smoke.test.ts for robust, fast cleanup and socket removal.
</bad_example>
