# Technical Specification: RAG & Knowledge Engine System Reference

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
This document details the technical design and architecture for the RAG & Knowledge Engine System Reference. It expands on the requirements outlined in `PRD.md` and aligns with the project goals in `../.cursor/rules/_project.mdc` and global guidelines in `../.cursor/rules/_global.mdc`.

### 1.2 Goals
*   Define the system architecture and component interactions.
*   Specify the technology stack and libraries for the baseline implementation.
*   Outline the data flow for ingestion, retrieval, and generation.
*   Provide a foundation for iterative development and future enhancements.

*Diagram to be refined as components are implemented.*

### 2.2 Components
*   **Ingestion Pipeline:** Handles loading, processing, and embedding documents.
    *   **Document Loader:** Reads documents from various sources.
    *   **Text Splitter:** Divides documents into manageable chunks.
    *   **Embedding Model:** Converts text chunks into vector embeddings.
*   **Vector Store:** Stores and indexes document embeddings for efficient retrieval.
*   **Query Processor:** Handles user queries, potentially including query transformation.
*   **Retriever:** Fetches relevant document chunks from the Vector Store based on the processed query.
*   **LLM for Generation:** Synthesizes an answer based on the retrieved context and the original query.
*   **User Interface:** Provides a way for users to interact with the system.

## 3. Technology Stack (Baseline - Iteration 1)

*   **Programming Language:** Python (as per `_global.mdc`)
*   **Package Management:** Conda (as per `_global.mdc`)
*   **Core Framework:** LangChain (`langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, `langgraph` as per `_global.mdc`)
*   **Document Loaders:** LangChain community loaders (e.g., `PyPDFLoader`, `TextLoader`).
*   **Text Splitters:** LangChain splitters (e.g., `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`).
*   **Embedding Models:** Configurable via LangChain (e.g., `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, `OpenAIEmbeddings`). Initial default: `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
*   **Vector Store:** Configurable via LangChain. Initial default: `ChromaDB` for local development ease.
*   **LLM:** Configurable via LangChain (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`, `HuggingFaceHub`). Initial default: A small, locally runnable model if feasible, or a widely accessible API model.
*   **Testing:** `pytest` (as per `_global.mdc`)
*   **Linting/Formatting:** `flake8`, `mypy` (as per `_global.mdc`)

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Ingestion Flow
1.  Documents are provided from a source (e.g., local directory).
2.  `Document Loader` reads the content.
3.  `Text Splitter` breaks down content into chunks.
4.  `Embedding Model` generates vector embeddings for each chunk.
5.  Embeddings and corresponding text are stored in the `Vector Store`.

### 4.2 Query Flow
1.  User submits a query via the `User Interface`.
2.  `Query Processor` (initially simple pass-through) prepares the query.
3.  `Retriever` uses the query embedding to find similar document chunks in the `Vector Store`.
4.  Retrieved chunks (context) and the original query are passed to the `LLM for Generation`.
5.  The LLM generates an answer.
6.  The answer is returned to the user via the `User Interface`.

## 5. Modularity and Interfaces
*   Components will be designed as Python classes/functions with clear interfaces.
*   LangChain's Runnable protocol (`langchain-core.runnables`) will be leveraged extensively to chain components and ensure interchangeability.
*   Configuration files (e.g., YAML or Python dicts) will be used to manage LLM choices, embedding models, and other parameters.

## 6. Logging and Observability
*   Leverage Python's `logging` module.
*   Key operations, errors, and component interactions will be logged.
*   LangChain's tracing/debugging capabilities (e.g., LangSmith, if configured) can be integrated for deeper insights.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Technical Perspective)
*   **Query Transformation:** Implement modules for HyDE, multi-query, etc.
*   **Advanced Retrieval:** Integrate hybrid search, re-ranking components.
*   **Agentic Frameworks:** Explore LangGraph for complex agentic behaviors.
*   **Evaluation:** Develop scripts for metrics like context relevance, answer faithfulness, etc.

## 8. Open Questions / Design Choices to Finalize
*   Specific initial default LLM model (balancing performance and accessibility).
*   Detailed schema for storing metadata alongside embeddings in the Vector Store.
